## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª ICP (ideal customer profile)
Examples of reference audience ETL product:

üìç ‚ÄúMarketing analysts working in B2C companies with more than 100 employees located in the US. And they have a decent marketing budget, considering the fact that a company can afford to hire a dedicated marketing analyst. They currently manually export data from advertising and analytics tools or using proprietary tools that doesn‚Äôt work as expected. Then they spend hours on data cleansing and preparation. As a result, if they need a report they have to spend hours or days to get it.‚Äù

I single out 2 main groups of users who will be interested in the product. The column on the left are those who will set up and use it regularly. The column on the right is the decision maker and the people who will review the reports. The main pains of each group are described below.
| Marketing analysts, marketers|CMO, CTO, VP, CEO|
| --- | --- |
|Collect reports by hand|Need updated reports|
|Dashboard exists but keeps crashing|Need offline and online data in one place|
|Integrations need to be configured manually|Manual reports are tied to one person (risks)|

The sales cycle b2b product is long and you need to work with knowledge smoothly down the funnel. The strategy highlights the most effective channels for attracting. In the future, they can be supplemented by others (for example, Twitter, Video Display).

Here is a more detailed description of how to work with the marketing analysts segment.
