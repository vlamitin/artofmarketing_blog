[{"body":"üìç For almost 5 years I worked inside a digital agency and looked at client issues as a contractor. After the agency, I've been working on the client side for over 3 years and I notice a huge difference in approach. My findings from inside the business in the article are. Everything described below is purely my work experience in large corporations. These are recommendation for agency. 1Ô∏è‚É£ Business mood of agencies to partnership. Contractors from agencies are often psychologically unstable and quickly deflated, especially when working with large advertisers. Only a few out of hundreds understand the essence of customer service (not to get personal, not to put the client in stupid situations, \u0026quot;I do not know\u0026quot; is not the answer, to promise only executable, etc.). Bottom line is that few people know how to love a customer in a healthy way. The client will always be grateful for sober independence and initiative for himself, for the simplification of processes in favor of speed and optimization. Because: a good contractor is considered a credit to the person who works with him (he found good partners, he set up a process of interaction), such an agency helps to fulfill the plan, he has everything under control. The contractor is the engine, not \u0026quot;the movable\u0026quot;.\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the client's business goals. Internally, the big client always has an overall sales plan (top tier) for the year/quarter/month, where digital ads is one of many tools and has its share. You need to keep this in mind in your forecasts and plans and have arguments why we won't reach or can reach our share of the overall plan. The plan moves from top to bottom, the adapted forecast moves from bottom to top.\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Help the client protect your ideas internally. When working on the client side, you always need to answer the question of what this advertising will give us (avareness or direct sales?), how much will we spend/ how much will we get. So any digital plan will be protected on a par with the offline media plan and other plans. Each plan's utility ratio will be compared to each other in terms of cost/profit now/profit later. Therefore, it will not be superfluous to choose the right wording that is understandable to people who are not from digital.\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Corporate online to offline. A lot of top managers know about offline advertising and don't know how work digital ads. There is a correlation with age: the top managers in large corporations who give out money for advertising are usually 40+ years old. As a rule, they understand offline, but digital is a black box for them. You have to be ready to explain complicated things in simple language, to translate theses from the language of digital into the language of offline.\n5Ô∏è‚É£ Find out how to count unique users. A lot of clients wants to count the unique users covered and understand how much we paid for the show to a real user (not a cookie) - it's a dream. It's super important, but unrealizable in current realities. Not everyone understands that it's impossible to properly calculate (it's digital, damn!), so we keep counting approximately. Ideally, learn how to manage the distribution of ads between unique users, manage the price per impression to one real person in the end.\n6Ô∏è‚É£ People on the client side. People who understand at least one small process from and to and can manage it adequately are almost non-existent. In fast-growing companies the processes are often chaotic, and you get a mess of everything. A person who can do something turnkey (prepare, run, summarize the results, draw conclusions) is worth their weight in gold. Therefore, do not think that everything will be brought to you ready.\n7Ô∏è‚É£ Loyalty and retention users. It is important for businesses not only to attract customers, but also to retain them and develop their check. For this digital agencies often do not have enough energy, time or it is not a priority right now. But in the end, the greatest profit for the business comes from loyal clients, whose share needs to be constantly increased. The winner is the agency that looks ahead and offers a solution to retain users on an equal footing with user acquisition. Don't forget calculate it in your offers (but remember: it depends on clients business).\nNot all businesses have these details, but many that work with digital advertising. Use the information individually for your situation and pass it through a sieve of common sense.\n","link":"https://artofmarketing.blog/post/7-insights-from-working-in-digital-ads-at-customer-side-after-working-at-an-agency/","section":"post","tags":["Digital","Service","Strategy","B2B"],"title":"7 Insights from working in Digital Ads at customer side after working at an agency"},{"body":"üìç For almost 5 years I worked inside a digital agency and looked at client issues as a contractor.

I am currently working on a product closely related to cryptocurrency, blockchain and NFT, and am finding many points to explore. The cryptocurrency field is very fluid, with information updated daily. I am looking for answers and researching legislation, policies and ads systems. With this article, I am starting a series of posts about marketing in the cryptosphere where I will share information. I will update as I can, but no promises). üóÇ Specific My product is not tied to a specific country, so I am interested in running as extensive an advertisement as possible. But how do I organize the countries? I have grouped the countries into 3 groups. Not all countries are listed here, but only the main ones or especially interesting for selling cryptocurrencies for individuals and legal entities.\nThe first group includes the most cryptocurrency-loyal countries. Here there is usually a high competition in advertising auction =\u0026gt; more expensive user cost and higher quality. In the second column are \u0026quot;undecided\u0026quot; countries, where there is no clear position on crypto or there are difficulties with public cryptocurrency payments. Here mining users is cheaper than in the first group, but their quality is also significant. The third block includes countries where cryptocurrency is banned or severely restricted. I recommend excluding these countries from advertising targeting, because there is a very low percentage of people who use cryptocurrency. At the same time, you can collect a large amount of traffic on the topic of crypto here. In each group, countries are filtered in descending order of GDP (nominal):\nPriority 1 (Legalized) Priority 2 (Not prohibited) Priority 3 (Prohibition) USA UK China Japan Russia Indonesia Germany Brazil Turkey France Mexico Taiwan Italy Netherlands Iran Canada Saudi Arabia Vietnam South Korea Thailand Bangladesh Spain Sweden Egypt Australia Nigeria Pakistan Switzerland United Arab Emirates Algeria Belgium Ireland Morocco Austria Israel Bolivia Argentina Hong Kong Nepal Norway South Africa Afghanistan Philippines Denmark Singapore Colombia Colombia Portugal Chile Kazakhstan Finland Ecuador Czech Republic Dominican Republic New Zealand Uruguay Ukraine Lithuania Belorussia Jordan Estonia Cyprus El Salvador Iceland Georgia Armenia Malta üëâüèª Conclusions Before you launch and pay for an ad in your chosen ad network, make sure it is positive about cryptocurrency advertising. Understanding the status of cryptocurrency in the country you want will help you build a competent strategy and save time on account unbundling. By segmenting your ad campaigns by authorized geo, you'll be able to get through moderation faster.\nüïµüèª Sources Official provisions regarding cryptocurrency and financial services:\nMeta\nTwitter\nGoogle\nWishing you easy moderation and profitable traffic!\n","link":"https://artofmarketing.blog/post/geo-marketing-strategy-for-crypto-in-2022/","section":"post","tags":["cryptocurrency","blockchain","geo"],"title":"Countries for cryptoproducts marketing in 2022"},{"body":"","link":"https://artofmarketing.blog/tags/cryptocurrency/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"cryptocurrency"},{"body":"","link":"https://artofmarketing.blog/tags/geo/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"geo"},{"body":"","link":"https://artofmarketing.blog/tags/etl/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"ETL"},{"body":"üë®üèª‚Äçüíª ICP (ideal customer profile) Examples of reference for searching audience:\nüìç ‚ÄúMarketing analysts working in B2C companies with more than 100 employees located in the US.

They currently manually export data from advertising and analytics tools or using proprietary tools that doesn‚Äôt work as expected. Then they spend hours on data cleansing and preparation. As a result, if they need a report they have to spend hours or days to get it.‚Äù\nI single out 2 main groups of users who will be interested in the product.
