I am currently working on a product closely related to cryptocurrency, blockchain and NFT, and am finding many points to explore. The cryptocurrency field is very fluid, with information updated daily. I am looking for answers and researching legislation, policies and ads systems. With this article, I am starting a series of posts about marketing in the cryptosphere where I will share information. I will update as I can, but no promises). üóÇ Specific My product is not tied to a specific country, so I am interested in running as extensive an advertisement as possible. But how do I organize the countries? I have grouped the countries into 3 groups. Not all countries are listed here, but only the main ones or especially interesting for selling cryptocurrencies for individuals and legal entities.\nThe first group includes the most cryptocurrency-loyal countries. Here there is usually a high competition in advertising auction =\u0026gt; more expensive user cost and higher quality. In the second column are \u0026quot;undecided\u0026quot; countries, where there is no clear position on crypto or there are difficulties with public cryptocurrency payments. Here mining users is cheaper than in the first group, but their quality is also significant. The third block includes countries where cryptocurrency is banned or severely restricted. I recommend excluding these countries from advertising targeting, because there is a very low percentage of people who use cryptocurrency. At the same time, you can collect a large amount of traffic on the topic of crypto here. In each group, countries are filtered in descending order of GDP (nominal):\nPriority 1 (Legalized) Priority 2 (Not prohibited) Priority 3 (Prohibition) USA UK China Japan Russia Indonesia Germany Brazil Turkey France Mexico Taiwan Italy Netherlands Iran Canada Saudi Arabia Vietnam South Korea Thailand Bangladesh Spain Sweden Egypt Australia Nigeria Pakistan Switzerland United Arab Emirates Algeria Belgium Ireland Morocco Austria Israel Bolivia Argentina Hong Kong Nepal Norway South Africa Afghanistan Philippines Denmark Singapore Colombia Colombia Portugal Chile Kazakhstan Finland Ecuador Czech Republic Dominican Republic New Zealand Uruguay Ukraine Lithuania Belorussia Jordan Estonia Cyprus El Salvador Iceland Georgia Armenia Malta üëâüèª Conclusions Before you launch and pay for an ad in your chosen ad network, make sure it is positive about cryptocurrency advertising. Understanding the status of cryptocurrency in the country you want will help you build a competent strategy and save time on account unbundling. By segmenting your ad campaigns by authorized geo, you'll be able to get through moderation faster.\nüïµüèª Sources Official provisions regarding cryptocurrency and financial services:\nMeta\nTwitter\nGoogle\nWishing you easy moderation and profitable traffic!\n","link":"https://artofmarketing.blog/post/geo-marketing-strategy-for-crypto-in-2022/","section":"post","tags":["cryptocurrency","blockchain","geo"],"title":"Countries for cryptoproducts marketing in 2022"},{"body":"","link":"https://artofmarketing.blog/tags/cryptocurrency/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"cryptocurrency"},{"body":"","link":"https://artofmarketing.blog/tags/geo/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"geo"},{"body":"","link":"https://artofmarketing.blog/post/","section":"post","tags":null,"title":"Posts"},{"body":"","link":"https://artofmarketing.blog/tags/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Tags"},{"body":"","link":"https://artofmarketing.blog/tags/b2b/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"B2B"},{"body":"","link":"https://artofmarketing.blog/tags/etl/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"ETL"},{"body":"üë®üèª‚Äçüíª ICP (ideal customer profile) Examples of reference for searching audience:\nüìç ‚ÄúMarketing analysts working in B2C companies with more than 100 employees located in the US. And they have a decent marketing budget, considering the fact that a company can afford to hire a dedicated marketing analyst. They currently manually export data from advertising and analytics tools or using proprietary tools that doesn‚Äôt work as expected. Then they spend hours on data cleansing and preparation. As a result, if they need a report they have to spend hours or days to get it.‚Äù\nI single out 2 main groups of users who will be interested in the product. The column on the left are those who will set up and use it regularly. The column on the right is the decision maker and the people who will review the reports. The main pains of each group are described below.\nMarketing analysts, marketers CMO, CTO, VP, CEO Collect reports by hand Need updated reports Dashboard exists but keeps crashing Need offline and online data in one place Integrations need to be configured manually Manual reports are tied to one person (risks) The sales cycle b2b product is long and you need to work with knowledge smoothly down the funnel.
